Hi Humans:

I am Daniel Santinho, NBA player. I hope that you enjoy every single day of your life time! If some day you are lost in anguish or non sense just remember that we are being and not being at the same time. Just concentrate your mind in your "not being" existence. It will give you peace and wisdom.
